/*
  Shortens the media query setup
  This mixin uses a breakpoints map and a key in the breakpoint map to set up
  The breakpoint map is already included by default

  For example, to use mediaqueries for mobile:

  @use mq(mobile) {
    width: 50px;
  } 

*/
@mixin mq($mq-breakpoint-key, $mq-breakpoints: $breakpoints) {
  @if not map-has-key($map: $mq-breakpoints, $key: $mq-breakpoint-key) {
    @warn "Warning: `#{$mq-breakpoint-key}` is not a valid breakpoint name.";
  } @else {
    @media screen and (min-width: map-get($mq-breakpoints, $mq-breakpoint-key)) {
      @content;
    }
  }
}
